# sc_lbm
Shan and Chen 2D lattice Boltzmann method in C++

The code has full functionality to simulate single component - single phase (SC-SP) flow. User manual and a documentation are under way. Automatic documentation can be generated using [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/). `benchmarks` directory is a good starting resource.

Two component - two phase version is currently under development. This process should not break the existing SC-SP functionality. 

The users are encourages to report any issues or bugs. Improvement ideas are welcome!

The code has full functionality to simulate single component - single phase flow as well as two-component - two-phase flows. User manual and a documentation are under way. Automatic documentation can be generated using [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/). `benchmarks` directory is a good starting resource.

The users are encourages to report any issues or bugs. Improvement ideas and extensions are welcome!
